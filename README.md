Backgrund:

Mortgages, student and auto loans, and debt consolidation are just a few examples of credit and loans that people seek online. Peer-to-peer lending services such as Loans Canada and Mogo let investors loan people money without using a bank. However, because investors always want to mitigate risk, a client has asked to help them predict credit risk with machine learning techniques.

In this assignment several machine learning models was built to predict credit risk using data you'd typically see from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans), so different techniques had tobe employed for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes. The imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries was used to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques:

* Resampling
* Ensemble Learning
